### Built with

- Github Desktop

### What I learned

As always, putting the skills I learned to practical use makes me learn more efficiently and more in depth. In this particular project, I was able to learn to manipulate background image better and also align elements in the way that the client wants.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - W3schools is where I learned the foundations of html and css, and I always go back when I need to refresh my memory on something.
